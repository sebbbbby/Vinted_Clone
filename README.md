Vinted Clone Thanks for looking! (yes, extremely minimal README, this is a journey, so again, thanks for looking!

This was an early project to learn the basic of React. 

the basic idea is that you sign in , and are able to 'like' items which will stay with your account and be accesibleany time you sign in as it is saved to the local DB

(currently the project is local only and no hosted DB/SERVER)
